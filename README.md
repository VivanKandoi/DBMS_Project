# DBMS_Project
Contains all project files including MySQL and Python

DBMS_Project_01.py
This Python script is responsible for the initial data cleaning and transformation process. It takes raw input (presumably from a dataset such as NFL plays), processes it into a cleaner format, and outputs a CSV file named PlayCalls.csv for use in SQL and visualization tools like Tableau.

PlayCalls.csv
This is the cleaned, structured dataset generated by the Python script. It serves as the primary data source for creating and populating the SQL database. All the initial analysis and normalization steps are based on this file.

DBMS_Project_02.sql
This SQL file creates the initial database schema. It defines the PlayCalls table and populates it with data from the CSV. This script sets the foundation for further normalization steps.

DBMS_Project_03.sql
This file demonstrates the process of bringing the database into Second Normal Form (2NF). It identifies and removes columns that are partially dependent on the primary key, improving the structure of the database and reducing redundancy.

DBMS_Project_04.sql
This script applies Third Normal Form (3NF) principles to the database. It identifies and eliminates transitive dependencies by removing certain columns and restructuring the schema for greater integrity and maintainability.
